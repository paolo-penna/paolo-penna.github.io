Game Theory can be used to capture some key aspects in the design and analysis of distributed protocols. In particular, it becomes useful in understanding whether the users can benefit from manipulating the protocol. 

In this course we shall see only one technique which however turns out to have several applications. During the course we shall learn this approach through various problems (most of them being typical Computer Science applications).

<h2><a name="lecture 1"> </a> Lecture 1 (Monday 17 Feb, 10:00 - 13:00)</h2>
In this lecture we see what happens when players repeatedly best-respond in asynchronous settings. Our motivating example is the analysis (or design) of distributed protocols (like BGP or TCP). The goal is to obtain the following two conditions:
<ul>
<li> The protocol reaches a stable state (convergence to an equilibrium) 
<li> The participants have no interest in deviating from the protocol (incentive compatibility)
</ul>
This lecture shows that these two conditions hold if the underlying game has certain properties. As a first application, we discuss a simple "TCP-like" protocol which can be analyzed using this framework. 


<h2>Lecture 2 (Thursday 20 Feb, 10:00 - 13:00)</h2>
In this lecture we see only applications of the theory presented in the previous lecture. In particular, we discuss the following problems (tentative):
<ul>
<li> Congestion control (TCP-like protocols)
<li> Mechanism design (2nd-price auction, stable matching)
<li> Border Gateway Protocol in a realistic setting (Gao-Rexford model) 
</ul>
